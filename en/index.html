            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>This document synthesizes an international research project that aims to revolutionize the resolution of complex combinatorial optimization problems, specifically Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC).</p>
            <p>The project addresses a critical gap in computer science and operations research: while optimization algorithms like MILP are fundamental for sectors such as logistics, energy, and finance, their application to large-scale problems is often limited by high computational complexity. Current research, while promising, lacks a consensus on how to systematically accelerate MILP solvers.</p>
            <p><strong>Central Proposal:</strong> The project proposes the development of a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a deep learning prototype based on the "Learning to Optimize" (L2O) technique. Instead of replacing traditional solvers, the AI model will learn to configure them optimally and provide high-quality initial solutions (warm starts), drastically accelerating the time required to find the optimal solution. The prototype will be developed and validated in an on-premises supercomputing (HPC) environment.</p>
            <h4>Strategic Objectives:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accelerate MILP Solving:</strong> Demonstrate speedup and efficiency gains over standard solver configurations.</li>
                <li><strong>Predict Execution Time:</strong> Develop a model capable of estimating the execution time of optimization tasks, providing a valuable tool for operational planning and policy simulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop Open Tools:</strong> Produce and make available datasets, scripts, and an open-source software prototype to ensure reproducibility and foster new research.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration and Infrastructure:</strong> The research is a collaboration between leading Brazilian institutions — University of Brasília (UnB) and Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) — and the prestigious Andalusian Interuniversity Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DaSCI) at the University of Jaén (UJA), in Spain. The project will have access to the world-class supercomputing infrastructure of UJA's CEATIC center, including clusters equipped with NVIDIA A100 and V100 GPUs, essential for training advanced AI models.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Expected Impact:</strong> The project aims to generate incremental innovation, elevating the technology from a laboratory level (TRL4) to a prototype validated in a relevant environment (TRL6). The results have the potential to advance the state of the art at the intersection of Operations Research, AI, and HPC, with future applications in practical optimization challenges in public and private sectors.</p>

            <h3>Context and Project Justification</h3>
            <h4>The Relevance of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)</h4>
            <p>Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful mathematical framework used to model and solve complex decision-making problems involving continuous and integer variables. Its applications are vast and critical to the modern economy, covering areas such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Logistics and supply chain management</li>
                <li>Energy and production planning</li>
                <li>Financial portfolio optimization</li>
                <li>Telecommunications and network design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Over the last 20 years, the ability to solve MILP problems has increased by up to 1,000 times, driven by advances in hardware and algorithms. However, many real-world problems, especially in emerging fields like autonomous vehicles and cybersecurity, continue to demand real-time solutions that challenge the limits of current technology.</p>
            <h4>Gaps in Scientific Literature</h4>
            <p>Despite advances, research to accelerate MILP solvers is still emerging and fragmented. The project identifies three main gaps hindering faster progress:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Difficulty in Problem Classification:</strong> The absence of a systematic method for classifying MILP problem instances hinders the application of specific optimization strategies. This suggests the need to replace manual heuristics with adaptive learning approaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Unproven Potential of L2O Technique:</strong> The "Learning to Optimize" (L2O) approach shows great potential for improving solver performance but has not yet been definitively proven or effectively integrated into existing tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Underexplored Software Optimization in HPC:</strong> Literature on how to optimize MILP solving with parallel algorithms in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments is scarce and incipient.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="objectives-and-scope">
            <h3>Research Objectives and Scope</h3>
            <h4>Central Question and General Objective</h4>
            <p>The research is guided by the following question: “Is it possible to improve the performance of MILP solvers with deep learning and high-performance computing?”</p>
            <p>To answer this question, the project establishes the following general objective:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Develop and verify, within 12 months, a Proof of Concept (PoC) of an L2O deep learning pilot prototype that accelerates and improves the performance of optimization solvers and provides estimates of MILP job execution time intervals in on-premises HPC.
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Specific Objectives</h4>
            <p>The project is structured into five specific and interconnected objectives:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>O1 - Build Test Scenarios:</strong> Establish a reproducible set of problem instances (extracted from benchmark libraries like MIPLIB and MILPBench) and execution profiles for rigorous testing in the HPC environment.</li>
                <li><strong>O2 - Standardize Data Collection:</strong> Develop scripts and a standardized scheme for collecting rich data (logs, execution traces, resource usage, solver parameters), ensuring the quality and reproducibility of experiments.</li>
                <li><strong>O3 - Prototype the L2O Pilot:</strong> Develop the core of the project: a deep learning model (neural network) that, after training, will recommend optimized parameter configurations (presets) and generate initial solutions (warm-starts) to accelerate the MILP solver.</li>
                <li><strong>O4 - Obtain Execution Time Prediction:</strong> Use the data collected during L2O model training to build an execution time prediction system, offering point estimates and confidence bands (e.g., HitRate@±25%) for operational support.</li>
                <li><strong>O5 - Implement Analysis with Generative AI:</strong> Develop a generative AI agent to analyze and communicate research results through interactive dashboards, translating complex technical data into accessible summaries for managers and operators.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="methodological-and-technological-approach">
            <h3>Methodological and Technological Approach</h3>
            <h4>The "Learning to Optimize" (L2O) Strategy</h4>
            <p>The project's methodological core is the L2O technique, which represents a paradigm shift from traditional approaches. Instead of attempting to replace complex and well-established solvers, L2O uses AI models to guide them intelligently. The approach is based on a recent tutorial by Chen, Liu, and Yin (2024) and focuses on two fronts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solver Pre-configuration:</strong> The neural network will be trained to analyze the characteristics of an MILP instance and recommend a set of hyperparameters (a preset) that maximizes solver performance for that specific problem type.</li>
                <li><strong>Warm Starts Generation:</strong> The model will also learn to predict a high-quality initial solution. Providing this "hint" to the solver can drastically prune the branch-and-bound algorithm's search tree, leading to much faster convergence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For modeling, the project will explore Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and their convolutional variants (GCNN), architectures especially suited to represent the structure of optimization problems.</p>
            <h4>Testing Platform and Data Collection</h4>
            <p>Experiments will be conducted rigorously and systematically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solvers:</strong> State-of-the-art solvers will be used, including Gurobi (commercial, with academic license) and SCIP (open source), allowing for performance comparison and validation across different platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>HPC Environment:</strong> Data collection will be performed in an on-premises HPC environment, possibly managed by Slurm, reflecting a real-world usage scenario in research centers and large organizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> A standardized runner will be developed to automate instance execution, recording essential metrics such as wait and execution times, resource usage (CPU, memory), solver events, and applied configurations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Success Metrics</h4>
            <p>The performance of the L2O prototype will be evaluated against baselines (standard solver configurations) using a set of clear and objective metrics:</p>
